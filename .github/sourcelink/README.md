# SourceLink step-into verification

Fixtures for [`sourcelink-stepinto.yaml`](../workflows/sourcelink-stepinto.yaml),
which proves the *debugger* half of SourceLink end-to-end: that pressing **F11**
in a consumer steps into the library's **real source** (resolved via the
SourceLink map in the PDB), not a decompiled placeholder.

This complements [`sourcelink.yaml`](../workflows/sourcelink.yaml) (#149), which
proves every document in the PDB resolves to real GitHub content via
`dotnet sourcelink test`. Together they cover the full chain F11 depends on:
SourceLink map in the PDB → source-file resolution → GitHub raw-URL fetch.

## How it works

1. Build [`consumer/`](consumer/) with `-c Debug -p:ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true`.
   Its `ProjectReference` compiles the library with the **same SourceLink map a
   released package ships** (deterministic `/_/…` source roots that map to GitHub
   raw URLs), and Debug/non-optimized codegen so the step-into target isn't
   reordered away.
2. Run [`verify_stepinto.py`](verify_stepinto.py) — it drives
   [netcoredbg](https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg) over its MI interface to
   break in the consumer, step into `ChunkTransformer`'s constructor, and assert
   the resulting frame is the library's SourceLink-mapped source file with symbols
   loaded. If SourceLink or the sequence points were broken the step would land
   with no source and the script exits non-zero.

## Why a ProjectReference, not the packed NuGet

netcoredbg is the only CI-scriptable .NET debugger, and it does **not** reliably
pair a *package*-sourced assembly with its symbol-package (`.snupkg`) PDB — it
reports `symbols-loaded=0` and cannot step into it (verified during development).
A `ProjectReference` built with `ContinuousIntegrationBuild=true` produces a
**byte-identical SourceLink PDB**, so the SourceLink map under test is the same
one that ships; only the delivery path differs. The packed-package symbol/URL
resolution is covered by `sourcelink.yaml` (#149).

## Files

- `consumer/StepIntoConsumer.csproj` / `Program.cs` — the fixture consumer. The
  break line is marked `STEP_INTO_TARGET`.
- `Directory.Build.props` / `.targets` — empty isolation stubs so the consumer
  does **not** inherit the repo's analyzers / BannedSymbols / multi-TFM policy.
- `verify_stepinto.py` — the debugger driver (exit 0 = step-into resolved real
  source).

## Scope

Scheduled + manual, not a PR gate — debugger automation is heavier and slightly
less deterministic than a unit test, and SourceLink's raw URLs resolve only
against a pushed commit.
